# Course Summary

This course helped me understand how a SOC operates and how analysts handle security alerts.

I learned how alerts are triaged, how tools like SIEM and firewalls are used, and how to distinguish real threats from false positives.

This experience strengthened my interest in pursuing a SOC Analyst role.
