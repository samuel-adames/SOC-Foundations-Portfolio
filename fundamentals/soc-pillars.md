# SOC Pillars: People, Processes, and Technology

A SOC operates based on three fundamental pillars:

## People
Analysts, engineers, and managers who operate and maintain security operations.

## Processes
Defined procedures such as incident response plans, escalation paths, and alert handling workflows.

## Technology
Security tools such as SIEM, EDR, firewalls, and IDS/IPS that provide visibility and detection.
